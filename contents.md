# Biomedical Big data

### Public online resources:
- Oncomine (one of the first databases),
- TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas, probably the largest database),
   -- Site: cancergenome.nih.gov
   -- Main Data Portal: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC)
   -- G-DOC (Georgetown Database of Cancer),
   -- UNIPROT

### Bank of data:
- National Center for Biotechnology Information

### What data to analyze:
Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Proteomic


### Specific examples:

- DNS copy number
- Genome sequencing
- Gene expression
- MicroRNA
- Proteomics:
    -- Data acquisition, exchange, and formats
    -- Exercise

### Workflow:

-> Get molecular profiling data
-> Analyze genomic DNA, micro RNA, and other profiling data
-> Integrate data with phenotype and clinical info
-> System biology analysis and experimental validation

### Specifics:
- Definition
- Discuss types of molecular data available:
    -- germ line mutations
    -- gene expressions
    -- DNA copy number variation

### Algorithmic approach

- String algorithms to answer biological questions (where does a bacterium start copying its own DNA)
- Randomized algorithms (effective at finding regions of similarity (motifs) hidden in genes from the same organism)
- Existing tools for finding motifs
